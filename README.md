# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing an analysis on Kickstarter Data to uncover trends

##Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to identify and analyze kickstarter data from Theater projects and their funding data.

##Analysis and Challenges
May is the best month to ask for funding for a theater project, based on percentage of successful campaigns in this month.

The higher the goal, the less likely the project is to be funded.

##Results
Theater popularity spikes in the late spring and early summer. This is probably due to the interest in going out and doing things during these months, where people are deciding to be active due to the better weather.
There is not a lot of variances in failed projects based on Launch Date.

There is a lot higher percentage chance you will have your project funded if the requested goal is less than $10,000.
There is either not a lot of demand or not a lot of productions that requested or needed a very large budget, most likely because Kickstarter is not the proper method of asking for funding for large productions.
